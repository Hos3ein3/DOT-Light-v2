Fot the better vesion controling,i will leave the master or origin as the main repo  but add dev repo which merged with master after all test and developing.
for each project (Not System), We Will have to create new Branch with the project name 
if its possible, we will merge with main but maybe some project have some confilict with each other so we have to be carefull with that.
